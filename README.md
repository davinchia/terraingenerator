# terraingenerator

This is a virtual terrian generator written in WebGL. WebGL allows the browser to access and run things directly on a computer's graphics card. 

This project initially started as a upper level computer graphics final project. But since my partner and I were extremely interested, we extended the project and ended up implementing most modern graphics techniques, including, a SkyBox, Environmental Mapping, Billboarding, Infinite Tiling, Randomised Terrain Generation, and Dynamic Level of Detail. We left out ray tracing, because it requires alot of computation, and realistically cannot run in the browser.

As WebGL is an experimental technology, the code might not run as smoothly on all browsers. It currently has strange errors on the Mac, and Mac users should use Firefox, or WaterFox, if possible. 

Feel free to look through and borrow the code.

Note that the more powerful your processor, the more detailed the world. The current hosted version is optimised for entry-level laptops, and the program is not in its full glory.
